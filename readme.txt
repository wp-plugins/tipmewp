Inserts a "Tip Me" icon in WordPress & BBPress posts if user has a Twitter
account & has put the Twitter link in website field

== Description ==

This plugin inserts a TipMe icon in WordPress posts if the user has a Twitter
username and has put the Twitter link in their website field of their profile.  
TipMe buttons for BBPress posts are inserted so users can get tips if they just have a 
Twitter link defined in the website field of their profile.

In short, it creates a tweet that the ChangeTip bot pics up and delivers with just one click.

We are using it on some of our web sites, so thought others might enjoy using it on theirs,
but it comes without any warranty express or implied, and should be used at your own risk.
It is a quite simple concept so should be quite reliable.

This probably will work with earlier versions of WordPress, but has not been tested.


== Installation ==

1. Just upload the plugin or install from WordPress.org
2. Activate.
3. Select any settings you would like different from the default.  There are only two
   options - the icon to use and the default amount to tip.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the icon? =

Yes, in the settings.

= Can I remove the "Enter Twitter URL in profile website field to enable tipping" image?

Yes, just rename the original "no-twitter.png" to "no-twitter-orig.png"
and the "no-twitter-1pix.png" to "no-twitter.png".

= What does the Twitter URL look like? =

https://twitter.com/whateveryourtwitterusernameis
